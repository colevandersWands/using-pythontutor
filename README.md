# Using [PythonTutor](http://www.pythontutor.com/javascript.html#)

Being able to accurately predict how [JavaScript executes code behind the scenes](https://github.com/elewa-academy/js-notional-machine) is one of the most valuable skills you can have as a developer.  This is also one of the most important & challenging things to learn, so be regular and be diligent. 

To learn the notional machine as effectively as possible, step carefully through clear code snippets with PythonTutor.  To get the most out of using PythonTutor try always predicting what will happen before you click "next".

_PyTut Guide_

__Primitive Types__:
* (things that don't hold other things)
* live directly in the PythonTutor Frames.
* undefined, number, string, boolean, null
* each variable holding a primitive stores it's own copy of that primitive

__Object Types__:
* (things that store other things)
* live in the Objects column of PythonTutor
* variables point to these. 
  * ie: modfying one variable's object will modify any other variables pointing to that object
* functions, objects, arrays. (more of these later on)

__Frames__: 
* a new one is created each time a function is executed
* and closes when that function returns
* they contain their own variables in _lexical scope_
* have access to variable in parent (higher) frames
* cannot access variables in lower frames

__Arrows (pointers)__:
* these indicate what object a variable is referencing
* multiple arrows can point to the same object
